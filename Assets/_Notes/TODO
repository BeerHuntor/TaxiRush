//GAME IS BUGGY AS HELL.... CANT FIGURE OUT PASSENGERS. 

General Gameplay:
    ☐ Add Destinations

General Development (Coding Stuff):
    ☐ Clean up code, remove unneeded statements. 

Passengers:
    ☐ Delivery doesn't set the gameObject to active
    ☐ Doesn't destroy current passenger gameObject

✘ Passenger Behaviour: @cancelled(22-11-06 11:02)
    ☐ Trigger Check is not firing, gameObject not setting to active when delivered. 
    ☐ FIX: Not destroying gameobject
